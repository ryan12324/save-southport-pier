# History of Southport Pier

Southport Pier, opened in August 1860, is the oldest iron pier in the country. At 1,108 metres (3,635 ft), it is the second-longest in Great Britain after Southend Pier.

The pier was designed by James Brunlees and cost £8,700 to build. Originally, it was even longer at 1,340 metres (4,380 ft), but was shortened slightly over the years.
