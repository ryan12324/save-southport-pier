          <p>
            Heritage experts suggest that Southport Pier's Grade II listed status could be key to securing additional funding for repairs. Historic England representatives have been invited to assess the structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pier's unique architectural features and historical significance make it a strong candidate for heritage grants and preservation funding.
