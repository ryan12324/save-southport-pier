          Back in 1860, when Queen Victoria sat on the throne and Britain was at the height of its industrial might, Southport Pier first opened its gates to the public. This wasn't just any pier - it was a groundbreaking achievement, being the first iron-built pleasure pier in the country. At an impressive 1,108 meters (3,635 feet), it stands today as Britain's second-longest pier, a testament to Victorian engineering and ambition.

            During its heyday, the pier was a hub of entertainment and excitement. Charlie Chaplin himself performed here in the early 1900s, along with many other famous entertainers of the era. Visitors would pay a toll of 6d (equivalent to £2.75 today) to stroll along its length - a price deliberately set high to attract the most affluent visitors.

            One of the pier's most unique attractions were the daring divers who would leap from the tea house roof several times daily. Professors Osbourne and Powsey were particularly famous, with Powsey even performing spectacular bicycle jumps off the pier!

          Like any seaside structure, Southport Pier has faced its share of challenges. Storms and fires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries tested its resilience. The pier has been shortened from its original length, survived World War II (when it housed searchlights to spot enemy aircraft), and faced the threat of demolition in 1990 - saved by a single vote!

          From 1864, the pier featured a unique tramway system that became a beloved feature of visits to Southport. The original steam-driven tram was replaced with electric trams in 1905, and later diesel versions kept the service running into the modern era. The final tram service ended in 2015, marking the end of over 150 years of pier transport history.
