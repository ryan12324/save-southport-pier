        <p>Southport Pier is currently closed for safety reasons following advice from structural engineers. Extreme weather in December 2022 accelerated issues with the Pier's decking, requiring immediate closure to protect public safety.</p>
        <p>The Council has received structural surveys that confirm the need for extensive repairs before the Pier can reopen. These surveys highlight issues with both the decking and steelwork that must be addressed.</p>
